# wordscape_solver

wordscape_solver.py is a programmed designed to beat levels in the IOS and Android app called Wordscape. The script takes all unique combinations of letters and checks if they are in the english dictionary or not. There are two dictionaries used:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_dictionary.json

The above link has 10,000 common words and the link below has 400,000+ words. I used two dictionaries to make sure that all possibilities are found so the level could be beaten. To input a level, just change the character values in 'letters' list in the main method and run the script. Happy wordscaping!
