# wordscape_solver

wordscape_solver.py is a program designed to beat levels in the IOS and Android app called Wordscapes. The script takes all unique combinations of letters and checks if they are in the english dictionary or not. There are two dictionaries used:

The first link has 10,000 of the most common words and the second link has 400,000+ words. I used two dictionaries to make sure that all possible words are found and the user can pass the level. To input a level, just change the character values in 'letters' list in the main method and run the script. Happy wordscaping!
